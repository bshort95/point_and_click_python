point and click python game

## history

I remember my family loving a game series called myst. it was a point and click adventure game with puzzles  
that became more and more complicated as you progressed. in my teenage years I remember playing many flash escape room games,  
now physical escape rooms are all around i have particiapated in a couple myself.  
i wanted to combine the flash game feel with the myst spooky or uneasy ambiance   
and have an escape room format.   
as the player is trying to figure out why he is there and how to escape.

## the story

the story is simple enough, the player wakes up in the middle of a locked room and he has not idea how he got there. 
He needs to get out. the previous room ocupents  
have tried their best to help him by leaving clues. 
can you escape?

## how it was made.

I programmed the game in python using the pygame library. and I used vs code for my ide.

if you are interested is using pygame it is not to hard to set up. you will need to open your command prompt. 
and enter pip install pygame. this is assuming you already have python installed.

the game has a main class where it gets stuff done and a Keypad class to help with one of the puzzles

the game itself uses a lot of assets, i dont want to give away any puzzles but i do want to show a few examples of basic maneuverability.

as you start the game you will notice two arrows, one on each side

![screen example](https://github.com/bshort95/point_and_click_python/blob/main/point_and_click_python/Capture.JPG?raw=true)

you can press either the left or right arrow to move in either direction, while in a room you can click any thing you want. 
when you click certain areas you can zoom into an object,

when this happens an arrow will appear above so you can press it and  get back into the room.
the only other thing you need to know is that there are time where you will get tools, and sometimes you have to press those tools in your toolbar to make it work,

just try the game and see if you can figure it out

## other game features
the game is a base soundtrack  
and some sound effects.   
the music is from a royalty free company   
and the sound effects were created by me.  
although they cost nothing i did recieve plenty of strange looks from my roomates as i was acting as a folley artist.
